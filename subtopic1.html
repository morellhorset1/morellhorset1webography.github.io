            <td>AI in finance leverages technologies like machine learning to analyze data, automate tasks, and improve decision-making. It transforms processes like trading, fraud detection, risk management, and customer service. AI can perform high-speed, algorithmic trading based on real-time data, detect fraud by identifying unusual transaction patterns, and streamline loan processing by assessing creditworthiness efficiently. It also enhances customer interactions through AI-powered chatbots, personalizes financial planning, and provides advanced data analysis for market insights. Key players in AI finance include developers, CIOs, ethics officers, legal teams, and financial institutions, all working to ensure ethical and compliant AI use. Proper governance is essential for transparency, regulatory compliance, and responsible AI implementation, fostering trust and innovation across the industry.

            <td>AI is rapidly advancing, with Generative AI set to transform the financial sector by boosting efficiency, enhancing analytics, and creating new market opportunities. In finance, AI helps automate tasks, process vast datasets, and improve price discovery. Itâ€™s also expanding access to less liquid markets, like emerging economies. However, as AI drives faster market reactions and high-speed trading, risks to financial stability arise, including amplified market volatility and increased cyber threats. Regulators must adapt to these changes, monitoring interconnected markets and nonbank financial entities closely. The IMF is working to shape global AI policies, helping nations build resilience against potential disruptions AI might introduce to financial markets.</td>
